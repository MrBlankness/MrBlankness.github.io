Hi! I am Weibin Liao (廖伟斌), a Ph.D. candidate at Peking University, advised by [Prof. Yasha Wang (王亚沙)](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/wangyasha/zh_CN/yjfx/10532/list/index.htm).

I graduated from [College of Information and Electrical Engineering](https://ciee.cau.edu.cn/), China Agricultural University (中国农业大学信息与电气工程学院) with a bachelor degree, advised by [Prof. Zhenbo Li (李振波)](https://faculty.cau.edu.cn/lzb/list.htm) and from the [School of Computer Science & Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing Institute of Technology (北京理工大学计算机学院) with a master degree, advised by [Prof. Xuesong Li (李雪松)](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/bssds/cd86c91f836d4eb8b2ca82c8e3ca5f68.htm). 
I also collaborate with [Prof. Liantao Ma (马连韬)](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/malt) form Peking University, [Dr. Yinghao Zhu (朱英豪)](https://yhzhu99.github.io/) from The University of Hong Kong, [Dr. Junyi Gao (高峻逸)](https://aboutme.vixerunt.org/) from The University of Edinburgh, [Prof. Yifan Zhu (朱一凡)](https://zhuyf8899.github.io/) from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and [Dr. Haoyi Xiong (熊昊一)](https://sites.google.com/site/haoyixiongshomepage/) from Microsoft Research Asia closely.

My research interest includes **Reasoning**, **NL2SQL**, and **HealthCare** of Large Language Models. As the first author, I have published 10+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4yUXvDsAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences and journals such as NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, Inffus, ACM TOIS, IEEE TAI.
